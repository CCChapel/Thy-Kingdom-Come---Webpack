                            When his original students, the disciples, asked him how to pray, he said &ldquo;Pray 
                            like this: &lsquo;Our father, who art in Heaven&hellip; thy kingdom come, thy will be done, 
                            on earth, as it is in Heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; If you are a student and follower of Jesus, 
                            God is your father who has a will and a kingdom. This year, our church-wide 
                            vision is to pray vigilantly and work diligently to bring this prayer to fruition; 
                            to bring our father&rsquo;s will and kingdom here to earth.
                        </p>
