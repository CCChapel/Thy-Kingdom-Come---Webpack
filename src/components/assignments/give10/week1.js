                <div className="[ text-bigger bold ]">What is it?</div>
                <p>
                    Solitude is all about finding a quiet, calm spot to spend time with God by yourself. There are two parts to solitude:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>We remove the noise and chaos of our life, if only for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>We add in the voice of God, through his word.</li>
                </ol>

                <div className="[ text-bigger bold ]">Why take this time?</div>
                <p>
                    Our lives are often filled with noise and busyness. We are often on the go and typically multi-tasking. While this isn&rsquo;t 
                    all bad, we are made to take a breath and simply slow down. Psalm 46:10 calls us to &ldquo;Be still and know that I am God.&rdquo; 
                    There&rsquo;s something very restful and profound that happens when we create a quiet, calm time to be with God. The Psalmist 
                    knew its importance for deepening our relationship with God. It's our desire to see you and the church experience the same 
                    thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Psalmist&rsquo;s relationship with God was a deep one. We hope to become more like him as we create space to listen to God more 
                    closely, hear his voice more clearly and reflect on Christ more deeply.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        As close to 7:10 a.m. and 7:10 p.m. as possible, find a quiet place to be by yourself. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have only a Bible and a journal with you. Leave your phones and turn off all music and TV. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be still and quiet for the first half of your time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Read the passage for the day, and write down what God is saying to you from his Word and what impacts you from what youâ€™ve read.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Close in prayer.
