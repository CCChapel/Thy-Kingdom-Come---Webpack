There are two parts to solitude:</p><ol> <li>We remove the noise and chaos of our life, if only for a few minutes.</li> <li>We add in the voice of God, through his word.</li></ol><div class='[ text-bigger bold ]'>Why take this time?</div><p>Our lives are often filled with noise and busyness. We are often on the go and typically multi-tasking. While this isn&rsquo;t all bad, we are made to take a breath and simply slow down. Psalm 46:10 calls us to &ldquo;Be still and know that I am God.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something very restful and profound that happens when we create a quiet, calm time to be with God. The Psalmist knew its importance for deepening our relationship with God. It&rsquo;s our desire to see you and the church experience the same thing.</p><p>The Psalmist&rsquo;s relationship with God was a deep one. We hope to become more like him as we create space to listen to God more closely, hear his voice more clearly and reflect on Christ more deeply.</p><div class='[ text-bigger bold ]'>How will this work?</div><ol> <li>As close to 7:10 a.m. and 7:10 p.m. as possible, find a quiet place to be by yourself. </li> <li>Have only a Bible and a journal with you.

So seriously, in fact, that Jesus had to die. Because of Jesus, you will never be more loved by God than you are right now, but your sin still offends him. When you sin against your spouse, it does not end your marriage, but it does injure your relationship until you seek forgiveness. It&rsquo;s the same with God. Our sin by no means terminates our relationship with God, but it injures it. 1 John 1:9 says, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; When we confess, we get God&rsquo;s forgiveness which becomes the healing balm for our souls.

Think about how you have treated others or even the thoughts you have had about others that may be sinful.</li> <li><span class='bold'>Admit your sins to God:</span> Grab and journal and a pen and write a paragraph to God admitting the sins that came to mind.

Carson put it well when he said, &ldquo;Worship is the only proper response to God. It&rsquo;s ascribing or placing honor and worth toward God. Our worship as humans redeemed by Christ, therefore, is not generically God-centered but Christ-centered. Empowered by the Holy Spirit, worship is an all-of-life encompassing, never-ceasing kind of thing.&rdquo;<br />This means that worship isn&rsquo;t just something we do on Sundays at church. It&rsquo;s a lifestyle that we live daily in which we seek to praise God for who he is and give him glory. Specifically, during Give10 we want to focus on adoring God for who he is, confessing our sins, finding assurance in the cross and responding to Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice.</p><div class='flex portable--stack'> <div class='two-thirds portable--one-whole'><div class='[ text-bigger bold ]'>Why do we worship?</div><p>Because God is the one who is worthy of our worship.

We read in Acts 13:2 &ldquo;While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &lsquo;set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called him.&rsquo;&rdquo; The church sent Barnabas and Saul out as missionaries to share the good news about Jesus. Fasting played an important role in aligning the church and their prayers with that mission. Our hope is for fasting to have the same impact on you and our church.</p><p>The story of Barnabas and Saul (who is Paul) is a great one, as they had an enormous impact in helping people come to know Jesus. Through our time of prayer and fasting, we hope the same thing happens here, especially on Easter weekend.</p><div class='[ text-bigger bold ]'>How will this work?</div><ol> <li>Decide if you are going to do a food fast or something else (like social media, TV, etc).</li> <li>Observe the fast Thursday from 7:10 a.m. &ndash; 7:10 p.m. and other days if desired.</li> <li>During the fast: <ul> <li>Spend your meal times to realign your prayer times for people to come to know Jesus. Pray for those coming on Easter Weekend and the people&rsquo;s names on the floor of the church. Be led by <a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A5-15&version=ESV' target='_blank'>Matthew 6:5-15</a> and <a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A1-7&version=ESV' target='_blank'>1 Timothy 2:1-7</a> in your prayer time.</li> <li>When you are getting uncomfortable, read God&rsquo;s Word.
